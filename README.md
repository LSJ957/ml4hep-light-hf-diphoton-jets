## Abstract
In this study, we explore the phenomenological signatures associated with a light fermiophobic Higgs boson, $h_{\rm f}$, within the type-I two-Higgs-doublet model at the HL-LHC. Our meticulous parameter scan illuminates an intriguing mass range for $m_{h_{\rm f}}$, spanning $[1,10]{\;{\rm GeV}}$. This mass range owes its viability to substantial parameter points, largely due to the inherent challenges of detecting the soft decay products of $h_{\rm f}$ at contemporary high-energy colliders. Given that this light $h_{\rm f}$ ensures $\text{Br}(h_{\rm f}\to\gamma\gamma)\simeq 1$, $\text{Br}(H^\pm \to h_{\rm f} W^\pm)\simeq 1$, and $M_{H^\pm}\lesssim 330{\;{\rm GeV}}$, we propose a golden discovery channel: $pp\to h_{\rm f}H^\pm\to \gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma \,\ell^\pm\nu$, where $\ell^\pm$ includes  $e^\pm$ and $\mu^\pm$.  However, a significant obstacle arises as the two photons from the $h_{\rm f}$ decay mostly merge into a single jet due to their proximity within $\Delta R<0.4$. This results in a final state characterized by two jets, rather than four isolated photons, thus intensifying the QCD backgrounds. To tackle this, we devise a strategy within \textsc{Delphes} to identify jets with two leading subparticles as photons, termed diphoton jets. Our thorough  detector-level simulations across 18 benchmark points predominantly show signal significances exceeding the $5\sigma$ threshold at an integrated luminosity of $3{\;{\rm ab}^{-1}}$. Furthermore, our approach facilitates accurate mass reconstructions for both $m_{h_{\rm f}}$ and $M_{H^\pm}$. Notably, in the intricate scenarios with  heavy charged Higgs bosons, our application of machine learning techniques provides a significant boost in significance.
